# SceneFormer: Indoor Scene Generation with Transformers

![Examples of scenes generated by Sceneformer](img/teaser_new.png)

Initial code release for the [Sceneformer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09793), contains models, train and test scripts for the shape conditioned model. Text conditioned model and detailed README coming soon.

# Setup
Install the requirements in `requirements.txt` and `environment.yaml` in a conda environment. Packages that are common can be installed either through
pip or conda.

# Prepare Data
The SUNCG dataset is currently not available, hence all related files have been removed. The dataset can be prepared with the scripts which were taken  from [deepsynth](https://github.com/brownvc/deep-synth).

# Train
Configure the experiment in `configs/scene_shift_X_config.yaml` where `X` is one of `cat, dim, loc, ori`

Then run 
```
python scene_scripts/train_shift_X_lt.py configs/scene_shift_X_config.yaml
```
to train the model `X`.

# Test
Configure the model paths in `scene_scripts/test.py` and then run 
```
python scene_scripts/test.py
```
